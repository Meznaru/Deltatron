Introduction
============

Welcome to the Deltatron rationale.

The purpose of this document is to document various levels of program design decisions
that are made throughout the development of Deltatron. For myself, the original author,
these pages serve as a reminder for my future self as to why I made certain decisions
and as a means to provide a medium for "self-debate": There are an unknown number of ways
to design any aspect of any program; consequently, I feel the need to provide a method for
writing down my reasons for choosing to implement these aspects in particular ways.

As time moves onward I lose track of the reasons behind my design decisions, which can lead
to me questioning my past-self's motives.

To my future self I proclaim: "Read this document!"

I do not require much of my future self, but upon this one directive I shall not yield.
